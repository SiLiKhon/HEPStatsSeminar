        "General characteristics of Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **clean and simple language:** Easy-to-read and intuitive code, easy-to-learn minimalistic syntax, maintainability scales well with size of projects\n",
        "*   **expressive language:** Fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Technical details:\n",
        "\n",
        "*    **dynamically typed:** No need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types\n",
        "*   **automatic memory management:** No need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays. No memory leak bugs\n",
        "*  **interpreted:** No need to compile the code. The Python interpreter reads and executes the python code directly\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The main advantage is ease of programming, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code\n",
        "* Well designed language that encourage many good programming practices:\n",
        " *  Modular and object-oriented programming, good system for packaging and re-use of code. This often results in more transparent, maintainable and bug-free code\n",
        " * Documentation tightly integrated with the code\n",
        "* A large standard library, and a large collection of add-on packages\n",
